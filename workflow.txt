Git workflow ->

Permanent Branches
main: This branch stores the official, production-ready release history. Commits on main are typically tagged with version numbers (e.g., v1.0, v1.1).
develop: This branch serves as the main integration branch for the next release. All new features are merged into develop and it contains the current pre-production
code.

Supporting Branches
These branches have a limited lifespan and are merged back into one of the permanent branches when their purpose is fulfilled.

Feature branches:
Purpose: To develop new features or enhancements in isolation.
Created from: develop.
Merged into: develop.
Key action: git flow feature start [feature_name].

Release branches:
Purpose: To prepare for a new production release, allowing for final bug fixes, testing, and documentation without disrupting ongoing development in develop.
Created from: develop.
Merged into: Both main (and tagged with a version number) and back into develop.
Key action: git flow release start [release_version].

Hotfix branches:
Purpose: To quickly address critical bugs in the production code (main branch).
Created from: main.
Merged into: Both main (and tagged) and develop (to ensure the fix is in the next release).
Key action: git flow hotfix start [hotfix_name].
