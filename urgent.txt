Key Steps in a Hotfix Branch Strategy

Identify & Branch: A critical bug is found in the live main/master branch. A hotfix-* branch is created directly from the main/master branch's latest commit.
bash
	git checkout -b hotfix-1.2.1 main



Develop & Test: Developers work only on the hotfix branch, fixing the bug and performing unit/integration tests in isolation, ensuring no new features are added.

Merge to main/master: Once the fix is verified, it's merged back into the main/master branch, which is then tagged (e.g., v1.2.1) and deployed to production.
bash
	git checkout main
	git merge hotfix-1.2.1
	git tag -a 1.2.1

Merge to develop: The hotfix is also merged into the develop branch (or current release branch) to ensure the fix is included in future releases and doesn't get lost.
bash
	git checkout develop
	git merge hotfix-1.2.1

Cleanup: The hotfix-* branch is deleted.
bash
	git branch -d hotfix-1.2.1
